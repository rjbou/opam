## Version
  *

## Global CLI
  * Add default cli mechanism: deprecated options are accepted (in the major version) if no cli is specified [#4575 @rjbou]
  * Add `opam config` deprecated subcommands in the default cli  [#4575 @rjbou - fix #4503]

  * Clearer messages about using --cli and OPAMCLI [#4655 @dra27]
  * The options `--root` and `--switch` are now reflected in environment variables when building packages
    so that calls to `opam` during build access the correct root and switch [#4668 @LasseBlaauwbroek]
  * Add cli versioning for enums of flags with predefined enums [#4626 @rjbou]
  * ◈ Add `--confirm-level` and `OPAMCONFIRMLEVEL` [#4582 @rjbou - fix #4168]
    * Take content of cli flags over environment variables, instead of already computed answer [#4691 @rjbou - fix #4682]
  * ◈ Add `--no` [#4582 @rjbou]
  * Initialise environment variables for plugins call/install [#4582 @rjbou]
  * `OPAMCONFIRMLEVEL` and `OPAMYES` now override "lower" CLI flags [#4683 @dra27 - fix #4682]

## Init
  * Introduce a `default-invariant` config field, restore the 2.0 semantics for
    `default-compiler` [#4607 @AltGr]
  * Fix default invariant with no system compiler [#4644 @AltGr - fix #4640]

  * If opam root is different from the binary, allow reading it and try to read in best effort mode  [#4638 @rjbou - fix #4636]
  * Don't check opam system dependencies on reinit after a format upgrade [#4638 @rjbou]

## Config report
  * Fix `Not_found` (config file) error [#4570 @rjbou]
  * Print variables of installed compilers and their (installed) dependencies [#4570 @rjbou]

## Install

  * Keep global lock only if root format upgrade is performed [#4612 @rjbou - fix #4597]
  * Improve installation times by only tracking files listed in `.install` instead of the whole switch prefix when there are no `install:` instructions (and no preinstall commands) [#4494 @kit-ty-kate @rjbou - fix #4422]
  * Scrub OPAM* environment variables added since 2.0 from package builds to prevent warnings when a package calls opam [#4663 @dra27 - fix #4660]
  * Correct the message when more than one depext is missing [#4678 @dra27]
  * Only display one conflict message when they are all owing to identical missing depexts [#4678 @dra27]

## Remove
  *

## Switch
  * Don't exclude base packages from rebuilds (made some sense in opam 2.0
    with base packages but doesn't make sense with 2.1 switch invariants) [#4569 @dra27]

## Pin
  * Don't look for lock files for pin depends [#4511 @rjbou - fix #4505]
  * Fetch sources when pinning an already pinned package with a different url when using working directory [#4542 @rjbou - fix #4484]
  * Don't ask for confirmation for pinning base packages (similarly makes no
    sense with 2.1 switch invariants) [#4571 @dra27]

## Lock
  * Don't write lock file with `--read-only', `--safe`, and `--dryrun` [#4562 @rjbou - fix #4320]

  * Config: add `opam-root-version` field as a marker for the whole opam root [#4638 @rjbou - fix #4636]
