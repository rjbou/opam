## Version
  * Bump to `release candidate [#4645 @rjbou]

## Global CLI
  * Add default cli mechanism: deprecated options are accepted (in the major version) if no cli is specified [#4575 @rjbou]
  * Add `opam config` deprecated subcommands in the default cli  [#4575 @rjbou - fix #4503]
  * Add cli versioning for opam environment variables [#4606 @rjbou]
  * Deprecated `build-doc`, `build-test`, `make` [#4581 @rjbou]
  * Add cli versioning for enums of flags with predefined enums [#4606 @rjbou]
  * Ensure the symlink for a plugin is maintained on each invocation [#4621 @dra27 - partially fixes #4619]

## Init
  * Introduce a `default-invariant` config field, restore the 2.0 semantics for
    `default-compiler` [#4607 @AltGr]

## Config report
  * Fix `Not_found` (config file) error [#4570 @rjbou]
  * Print variables of installed compilers and their (installed) dependencies [#4570 @rjbou]

## Install
  * Don't patch twice [#4529 @rjbou]
  * With `--deps-only`, set dependencies as root packages [#4964 @rjbou - fix #4502]
  * Keep global lock only if root format upgrade is performed [#4612 @rjbou - fix #4597]

## Remove
  *

## Switch
  * Don't exclude base packages from rebuilds (made some sense in opam 2.0
    with base packages but doesn't make sense with 2.1 switch invariants) [#4569 @dra27]
  * Don't refer to base packages in messages any more [#4623 @dra27 - fixes #4572]

## Pin
  * Don't look for lock files for pin depends [#4511 @rjbou - fix #4505]
  * Fetch sources when pinning an already pinned package with a different url when using working directory [#4542 @rjbou - fix #4484]
  * Don't ask for confirmation for pinning base packages (similarly makes no
    sense with 2.1 switch invariants) [#4571 @dra27]
  * Fix version pin source retrieving: mustn't error if archive opam file is malformed [#4580 @rjbou]

## List
  * --silent renamed to --check [#4595 @dra27 - fix #4323]

## Show
  * Include doc field in opam-show [#4567 @dra27 - partially fix #4565]

## Option
  *

## Lint
  * Fix W59 & E60 with conf flag handling (no url required) [#4550 @rjbou - fix #4549]

  * Add E67 checksum specified with non archive url [#4635 @rjbou]

## Lock
  * Don't write lock file with `--read-only', `--safe`, and `--dryrun` [#4562 @rjbou - fix #4320]

## Opamfile
  * Fix `features` parser [#4507 @rjbou]
  * Rename `hidden-version` to `avoid-version` [#4527 @dra27]
